Click To Correction: Interactive Bidirectional Dynamic Propa-gation Video Object Segmentation Network    

High quality video object segmentation is a challenging visual computing task. Interactive seg-mentation can improve segmentation results. This paper proposes a multi-round interactive dynamic propagation instance level video object segmentation network based on click interaction. The network consists of two parts: user interaction segmentation module and bi-directional dy-namic propagation module. A prior segmentation network was designed in user interaction segmentation module to better segment objects of different scales that users click on. The dynamic propagation network achieves high-precision video object segmentation through bidirectional propagation and fusion of segmentation masks obtained from multiple rounds of interaction. Experiments on interactive segmentation datasets and video object segmentation datasets show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art segmentation results with fewer click interactions.   

The code will be coming soon.
